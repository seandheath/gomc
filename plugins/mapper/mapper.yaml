actions:
  # Movement actions: After you enter a direction the move should begin
  # and actions should be defined to indicate when the move is complete
  # as well as capturing relevant information like the new room name
  # and exits. These will be specific to each MUD - I've designed this
  # mapper to work for Nodeka as an example.
